Wurst-Blue Client for Minecraft Forge.

Not wurst client, but THE worst client!

Wurst-blue is the worst fork of wurst. Our plan with wurst-blue, is to be better than kami blue, but yet still be the worst fork of wurst. cookiedragon is still banned from this repository. This client is 100% skidded.

Pull requests are WELCOME!

# ForgeWurst

Wurst Client for Minecraft Forge.

This repository only contains the source code and is not intended for end users. Go to https://forge.wurstclient.net/ for ready-to-use downloads and installation instructions.

## How To Use This Code In Eclipse

1. Clone this repository.

2. Go into the `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` folder and run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace.bat`, followed by `gradlew eclipse.bat`.

3. Repeat step 2 for all of the remaining versions (currently just 1.12.2). Please always use the .bat files, as some versions will not work if you run the Gradle commands directly.

3. In Eclipse, go to `Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace`. Select the folder where you saved this repository as the root directory.

4. Select all of the projects that Eclipse has found (currently just two), then click <kbd>Finish</kbd>. At this point `ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2` is already working, but `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` still shows some errors. That's because we have a shared source folder in the 1.12.2 project that the other versions (currently just 1.10.2) also need access to.

5. Right-click on the `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` project and select `New > Folder`. Click on <kbd>Advanced >></kbd> and select `Link to alternate location (Linked Folder)`.

6. Click on <kbd>Browse...</kbd> and navigate to `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2\src\shared\java`. Change the "Folder name:" section from "java" to "shared-src", then click <kbd>Finish</kbd>.

7. The `shared-src` folder should now show up in Eclipse, under the `ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2` project. Right-click on this folder and select `Build Path > Use as Source Folder`.

8. Both projects should now be working without any errors. In the future, you will need to repeat steps 5-7 for all projects except the one that hosts the shared source folder.

## How To Compile The Project Into Runnable .JAR Files

After you have set up the code in Eclipse by following the above steps, the `gradlew build` script will only work for ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2. To make it work with the other versions (currently just 1.10.2), you will first need to create a directory junction from `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2\src\shared` to `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2\src\shared`.

1. Navigate to `ForgeWurst\ForgeWurst MC 1.10.2\src` and open the console. If you are using PowerShell, type `cmd` before continuing with step 2.

2. Run the following command: `mklink /J shared "../../ForgeWurst MC 1.12.2/src/shared"`.
